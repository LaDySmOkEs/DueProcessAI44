            - "key_defense_angles": An array of strings outlining potential defense angles for the criminal case.

            - "potential_motions": An array of objects, each with "motion_name" and "purpose" keys (e.g., Motion to Suppress, Brady Motion).
            - "civil_suit_viability": An analysis of the strengths and weaknesses for a future ยง1983 lawsuit.
